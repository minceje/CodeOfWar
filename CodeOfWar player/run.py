Strategy:
    First use given workers and given 100 Karbonite- replicate to make more? Worker research to upgrade them- costs 25 rounds
    10-15 workers for karbonite harvesting
    factory produce knights, want to research that unit one at a time, do not go over 3-4 times
    workers replicate
    
    Then create a rocket as soon as we can, multiple, and collect resources
    5-10 units work together to make rocket, per group of rockets (full capability is 12 at level 3)
    
    Around round 700, get in rockets and fly to Mars
    
    Mars: create as many units as possible to win

A MapLocation represents a concrete space on a given planet. It has x and y coordinates, 
in addition to the planet itself, as attributes.


A Location represents the location of a robot. Whenever a robot is on a map, this object maps directly to a MapLocation object. 
However, this is not always the case! A Location may also represent a point in space (as in the case of a rocket traveling to Mars), 
or a space in a structureâ€™s garrison. 
Methods can be used to determine, more concretely, what a Location represents.
